# Food Desire Models

The Food Desire Model project contains the data models used throughout the system. These models represent various entities and data structures used by the application.

## Usage

The models in this project are used to represent entities and data structures in the application. They provide a structured representation of the application's domain and are utilized by other layers of the system, such as the Data Access Layer (DAL) and Core layer.

When working with the models, consider the following guidelines:

- *Entities*: The entity classes represent the domain entities and encapsulate their properties and behavior. Use these classes to define the structure and behavior of the core entities in the application.
- *Enums*: The enum classes define enumerations that represent specific values or states in the application. They provide a type-safe way of working with predefined sets of values.
